## One big challenge

We do analyses multiple times, and often those analyese are not reusable. 

There is a gap between analysis and writing. 

## Useful techniques

- Functional programs
- Code segments
- RMarkdown

## Functional program

- construct functions
- use lapply, Map instead of for loop
- use list of functions

## code segments

  > ---- is the code segments ----
